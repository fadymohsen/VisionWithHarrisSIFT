## 1. Harris Corner Detection
### Overview
Harris Corner Detection is a popular feature detection algorithm used to identify the corners within an image. Corners are regions within an image with large variation in intensity in all the directions. The Harris Corner Detection algorithm is particularly useful in computer vision tasks that involve object recognition, motion detection, and image stitching.

### Usage
Instructions on how to use the Harris implementation, including required parameters and example calls.






## 2. Lambda Minus Method
### Overview
The Lambda Minus Method is a technique used to refine feature detection, providing an alternative to traditional methods by focusing on minimizing the smaller eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix, enhancing edge and corner detection capabilities.

### Usage
Detailed guide on employing the Lambda Minus Method within image processing workflows, highlighting parameter configurations.





## 3. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
### Overview
SIFT is an algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images. The algorithm identifies keypoints and computes keypoint descriptors, which are used for matching across different views of an object or scene.

### Usage
Step-by-step guide to running the SIFT algorithm, including tips on tuning parameters for various environments and purposes.

## 4. Feature Matching
### Overview
Feature matching involves identifying matches between different sets of features detected in multiple images based on the descriptors associated with each feature. This is critical for tasks such as object detection, registration, and tracking.
